Embedded Systems Robotic Arm Controlled by a Leap Motion 

The project proposed focuses on gathering the knowledge
obtained from the ECE 47100 and applying these concepts. 
The project envisions a robotic arm that will be controlled 
wirelessly by hand gestures where a PIC microcontroller will
be receiving values wirelessly via ZigBee using UART communication.
The group will focus on hacking the controller of the robotic arm 
as seen in the picture in order to control freely the PWM cycles
of the servos that control the arm. With the intention of mimicking 
what a hand does in the robotic arm, the project is a powerful mixture
of concepts that when finish will be a good project to keep adding new features.
